# AutomaticOrManualDownloaderWindows

Hello everyone. Anyone can use this Python code to download files from a URL or URLs automatically or manually. (Windows)

Python code will not run without administrator permission.

If the urls.txt file is located in the same folder as the Python code and contains one or more valid URLs, the Python code will automatically download them one by one. After the download is complete, you can manually enter a URL and press Enter to download the files one by one. To exit, type Exit and press Enter to close the Python code.

If the urls.txt file is missing, empty, or contains invalid URLs, the Python code will prompt you to enter a valid URL. After entering the URL and pressing Enter, the file will be downloaded. You can exit at any time by typing Exit and pressing Enter.

All downloaded files are saved in the DigitalMember_Assistant_Downloads folder, which is automatically created in the same location as the Python code when the Python code is run with administrator permissions. The results of each download (SUCCESS or FAILURE) are recorded in the log.txt file in this folder.
